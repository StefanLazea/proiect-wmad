# CatBoost
- [more info](https://towardsdatascience.com/catboost-regression-in-6-minutes-3487f3e5b329)

The main idea of boosting is to sequentially combine many weak models (a model performing slightly better than 
random chance) and thus through greedy search create a strong competitive predictive model
